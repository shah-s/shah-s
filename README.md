- 👋 Hi, I’m @shah-s. 
- 👀 I have been working in the IT world but most of my professional life I've been focused on the Ops and lean on Dev, learning to develop in the years to come.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning version controls, OS architecture, cloud engineer (CI/CD), Python, Java, PowerShell and Windows Perfomance --debug dumps, look behind the curtain and see how it all works.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Modern apps for Windows, OpenSSH and bit more
- 📫 How to reach me? email: syedshah.mke@gmail.com
- Everyday of IT is a fun day particularly when it is.
